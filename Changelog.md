## AMP HTML Validator 1.0.0 released
- AMP HTML Validator 1.0.0 is an initial release. The goal of this project is to keep updating the code with small fixes and features. This project requires unit tests and code coverage by default, and uses github and a automated pipe-line to publish new versions in a automated fashion for every commit that is merged, without humans need for each release.
